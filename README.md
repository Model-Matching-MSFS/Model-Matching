# Model-Matching
Flight Sim Model Matchings (FSMM)'s goal is to provide high-quality model matching for the new Microsoft Flight Simulator. 
We are making our custom models, textures, and liveries. 
Our Model Matching will work with Vatsim and IVAO and may expand in the future. 
If you would like to contribute models or texturing please DM Awemeter. In the future, you will not need to DM me to contribute things like liveries, texturing, and models.
